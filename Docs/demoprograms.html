<H1>Sample programs</H1>

<HR>

The directory "64prgs" contains some little sample programs to show the
capabilities of Frodo/Frodo SC. Except for "dadb" and "lrborder" they are all loaded with
<CODE>LOAD"&lt;name&gt;",8,1</CODE> and started with <CODE>SYS49152</CODE>.
To do so, you have to set "Drive 8" in the settings to "Dir" and set the
path to '64prgs' so Frodo will find the programs.<P>

The programs were written by Pasi Ojala, Marko M&auml;kel&auml;, Andreas
Boose and me. If you like, you can try them on other emulators or on a real
C64.<P>

to scroll left/right, 't' for text mode, 'g' for bitmap mode), requires Frodo SC

<H4>dadb</H4>
A program running in the color RAM (press space), requires Frodo SC

<H4>de00all</H4>
