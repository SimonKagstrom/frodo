There are two kinds of Frodo distributions. The source distributions ("FrodoV?_?.Src.*")
contain source code that has to be compiled on your system. The binary distributions
("FrodoV?_?.<system name>.*") contain an executable that can be started directly.

<H2>Compiling under BeOS</H2>

There are BeIDE project files for Frodo ("Frodo.proj"), Frodo PC ("FrodoPC.proj")
and Frodo SC ("FrodoSC.proj"). You must rename (or copy) Src/sysconfig.h.Be
to Src/sysconfig.h first. Compilation requires the unlimited Metrowerks
linker.

<H2>Compiling under Unix</H2>

First you have to run the program "configure". This can be done simply with
the following command:<P>

<KBD>cd Src<BR>
./configure</KBD><P>

You might want to give configure optional arguments. To use SVGAlib on Linux
systems, you have to do<P>

<KBD>cd Src<BR>
./configure --without-x</KBD><P>

To select a german keyboard layout in the X11 version instead of the usual
US keyboard, do<P>

<KBD>cd Src<BR>
./configure --enable-kbd-lang-de</KBD><P>

After running configure, you may want to edit the generated Makefile. To use the SHM
extension (highly recommended for speed), add "-DX_USE_SHM" to the definition of
CFLAGS.  To get sound under Solaris 2.x, add "-DSUN". Next, type<P>

<KBD>make all</KBD><P>

<H2>Compiling under AmigaOS</H2>

The makefile was written for the ADE with GCC. Other compilers have not been tested.
You must rename (or copy) Src/sysconfig.h.Amiga to Src/sysconfig.h first. Then type<P>

<KBD>cd Src<BR>
make -fMakefile.Amiga all</KBD><P>

<H2>The C64 ROM files (all systems)</H2>

Frodo looks for four ROM files named "Basic ROM", "Kernal ROM", "Char ROM"
and "1541 ROM" in the same directory Frodo is in. These files are included
in the source and binary distributions of Frodo. "Kernal ROM" is an
<A HREF="kernal.html">extended</A> version of the C64 Kernal.
