<STRONG>Frodo</STRONG> is a freeware C64 emulator for BeOS, Unix, MacOS, AmigaOS,
Win32 and RiscOS systems and the world's first C64 emulator not bearing a
"64" in its name. <TT>:-)</TT> (No, it has absolutely nothing to do with
frodo.hiof.no, that's a pure coincidence.)<P>

Frodo was developed to reproduce the graphics of games and demos better
than the existing C64 emulators. Therefore Frodo has relatively high system
requirements: It should only be run on systems with at least a
PowerPC/Pentium/68060. But on the other hand, Frodo can display raster
effects correctly that only result in a flickering mess with other
emulators.<P>

Frodo comes in three <A HREF="flavours.html">flavours</A>: The "normal" Frodo
with a line-based emulation, the improved line-based emulation "Frodo PC",
and the single-cycle emulation Frodo SC that is slower but far more
compatible.<P>

In addition to a precise 6510/VIC emulation, Frodo features a processor-level
1541 emulation that is even able to handle about 95% of all fast loaders.
There is also a faster 1541 emulation for four drives in .d64/x64 disk
images, .t64/LYNX archives, or directories of the host system.<P>

Frodo runs on these systems:<P>

<UL>
<LI>BeBox or PowerMac with BeOS Preview Release
<LI>Unix systems with X11R6 or Linux/SVGAlib (sound only under Linux, HP-UX and Solaris 2.x)
<LI>68k or PPC Macintosh with System 7.5
<LI>Amiga/DraCo with 68040/68060, AmigaOS 3.0 and a graphics card (AHI V3 required for sound)
<LI>Intel x86 system running Windows NT/95
<LI>Acorn computers with RiscOS 3
