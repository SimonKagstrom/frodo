If you find a bug or a misfeature in Frodo, or have an idea how to make
some things better, then please drop me a note so I'll be able to improve
Frodo in the future. However, I'm not interested in reports about programs
that "don't work" unless you have tested them with both Frodo SC and a
real C64. My address can be found <A HREF="author.html">here</A>.
Questions about the Unix version should go to
<A HREF="mailto:crux@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de">Bernd Schmidt</A> (esp. Linux) and
<A HREF="mailto:lkv@mania.robin.de">Lutz Vieweg</A> (esp. HP-UX).
Questions about the Mac version should go to
<A HREF="mailto:titan@indigo.ie">Richard Bannister</A>.
Questions about the Win32 version should go to
<A HREF="mailto:jrs@world.std.com">J. Richard Sladkey</A>.
Questions about the Acorn version should go to
<A HREF="mailto:dehmel@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">Andreas Dehmel</A>.<P>

I don't think the emulation can be made much faster without changing the
concept but I'd be happy to find someone showing me how to do it.<P>
