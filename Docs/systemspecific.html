<H1>System specific notes</H1>

<HR>

<H2>BeOS</H2>

Frodo may be started from the shell or from the Tracker. When started from
the shell, Frodo accepts a single argument: The name of a preferences file
to load instead of the default "Frodo Prefs".<P>

At first, the window for the emulation <A HREF="settings.html">settings</A>
appears. The actual emulation is started by a click on "Start". Then the <A
HREF="emulwindow.html">emulation</A> window appears in which the C64
startup message is displayed.<P>

You can quit from the running emulation by selecting the "Quit" menu
item.<P>

Frodo should be run in a 256-color workspace for maximum speed.<P>

Sampled sounds are only played correctly if "Limit Speed" is on and "Draw every
n-th frame" is set to "1" and if the emulation can sustain 100% speed.<P>

<H2>Unix</H2>

Frodo accepts a single argument when started from the shell: The name of a
preferences file to load instead of the default "~/.frodorc".<P>

First the <A HREF="emulwindow.html">emulation</A> window appears in which
the C64 startup message is displayed. If you have Tcl/Tk 4.1 installed
and the file "TkGui.tcl" is in the current directory, a second window opens
for the emulation <A HREF="settings.html">settings</A>.<P>

If you have no Tcl/Tk or are using the SVGAlib version under Linux, you
have to copy the included "Frodo Prefs" file to "~/.frodorc" and edit it manually
(read "Prefs.cpp" to find out about the syntax of the settings file).

You can quit from the running emulation by pressing F10.<P>

Sound is currently only supported under Linux, HP-UX and Solaris 2.x. Sampled
sounds are only played correctly if "Limit Speed" is on and "Draw every n-th frame"
is set to "1" and if the emulation can sustain 100% speed.<P>

<H2>MacOS</H2>

Frodo is started by double-clicking its icon.<P>

You can quit from the running emulation by selecting the "Quit" menu
item.<P>

Frodo should be run with 8-bit color depth. The "DIR" 1541 emulation mode
and SAM are currently not implemented.<P>

See the file "MacFrodo Notes" for more information.<P>

<H2>AmigaOS</H2>

Frodo should be started from the shell. When started from the shell, Frodo
accepts a single argument: The name of a preferences file to load instead
of the default "Frodo Prefs".<P>

At first, the window for the emulation <A HREF="settings.html">settings</A>
appears. The actual emulation is started by a click on "OK". Then the <A
HREF="emulwindow.html">emulation</A> window appears in which the C64
startup message is displayed.<P>

You can quit from the running emulation by selecting the "Quit" menu
item.<P>

Frodo opens its windows on the default public screen. This screen should
be a 256-color screen on a graphics card, otherwise the emulation will
be very slow.<P>

The AmigaOS version is somewhat experimental. You need AHI to get sound,
but the sound emulation is not very good. It might be better to leave the
SID emulation turned of for now. Only one joystick (on port 2) is supported.<P>

<H2>RISC OS</H2>

Frodo is started by double-clicking its icon. The shared resources stored in
!FrodoRsrc must have been seen by the filer first, otherwise the program will
abort with an error. Frodo and FrodoPC need 1344kB, FrodoSC 832kB to run.<p>

Frodo can be controlled with the menus and the <a href="emulwindow.html">emulator
pane</a>. You can load snapshots and native C64-files (which usually have the
filetype &64) by dragging them to the emulator window.<p>

Frodo can be run in any colour-depth, although 16bpp and especially 32bpp are
noticably slower than the others. You can toggle between two display sizes
using the pane.<p>

For a lot more information see the file !Help supplied in the RISC OS
distribution.
